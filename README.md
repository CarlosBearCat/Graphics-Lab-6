Creating a randomized fractal landscape using the Diamond Square Algorithm 
Some of the files contain code worked on by old partners from previous projects and are even unnecessary, such as the Robot.js file. 
The core of the project lies in the Fratcal.js file. 

If you'd like to see the randomly generated fractal landscape, download this repo and run the start_here html file in your browser!
